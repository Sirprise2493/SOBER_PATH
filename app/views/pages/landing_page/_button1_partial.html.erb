      <p>
        SoberPath is your structured, digital companion on the journey to an alcohol-free life.
        Instead of carrying everything alone, you have a private space to reflect on your thoughts,
        feelings, and daily experiences – and to see more clearly what supports you, what triggers you,
        and what truly matters to you.

      <p>
        Many people struggling with alcohol face the same daily challenges:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>😔 Isolation and shame</li>
        <li>🔄 High risk of relapse without support (40–60% according to NIAAA)</li>
        <li>⏰ No flexible 24/7 support when cravings hit</li>
        <li>📉 Little sense of visible progress</li>
        <li>📊 Only about 1 in 10 receives professional help (WHO)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        SoberPath aims to ease some of this weight by giving you a discreet, digital community
        that can be with you wherever you are in the world. It is a place to feel seen, encouraged,
        and reminded that you are not doing this alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you can do in SoberPath:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Daily journal with AI visuals</strong><br>
          Capture your thoughts, cravings, wins, and difficult moments in a daily journal.
          Based on what you write, an AI-generated image can reflect the mood of your entry
          and make your journey visible over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chatroom and community support</strong><br>
          Talk to an AI when you want to sort your thoughts anonymously, and join a general
          group chat to connect with other users. Every message can feel like a mini AA meeting:
          you share, you listen, you encourage – and you can build real connections by
          celebrating each other’s milestones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Milestone page</strong><br>
          See your sober milestones in one place and read the congratulations and encouragement
          from other users. Progress becomes not only measurable, but emotionally real.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Find AA meetings nearby</strong><br>
          When you feel the need for in-person support, you can look up registered AA meetings
          in your area and seek additional real-life connection.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        SoberPath is designed for adults aged 18 and over who want extra support with discretion,
        digital tools, and the power of community and motivation. Our platform is
        <strong>not</strong> a replacement for real-life AA meetings or for psychologists and
        professional addiction counselors. It is a complement: a safe, encouraging space that
        supports you in everyday life and helps you stay focused on your most important goal –
        a sober, self-determined life.
