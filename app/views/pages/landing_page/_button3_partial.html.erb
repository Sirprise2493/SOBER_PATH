        SoberPath is designed to support you in your daily life – but it is not meant to replace
        in-person support groups, addiction services, or professional treatment. Many people find
        it most helpful to combine digital tools with real-world help from doctors, therapists,
        peer groups and helplines.

        If you are worried about your drinking, or about someone close to you, it can be a strong
        and brave step to reach out for help. Below are some types of support you can explore.
        Availability depends on where you live, so it is always a good idea to search for local
        services in your own country or region.

        <li>
          <strong>Peer support groups (online and in person)</strong><br>
          Many people find strength in talking to others who understand their experience.
          Internationally, peer-led groups like
          <a href="https://www.aa.org/"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener"
             class="external-help__link">
            Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
          </a>
          offer meetings in many countries and languages, and an online intergroup for virtual meetings:

        <li>
          <strong>Professional treatment and helplines</strong><br>
          Talking to a doctor, therapist, or addiction counsellor can help you plan safe next steps.
          In some regions there are national helplines and treatment finders, such as:
          <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener"
             class="external-help__link">
            SAMHSA and FindTreatment.gov (USA)
          </a>,
          or
          <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-advice/alcohol-support/"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener"
             class="external-help__link">
            NHS alcohol support services (UK)
          </a>.
          If you are in immediate danger or feel at risk of harming yourself, contact local emergency
          services or a crisis hotline in your country right away.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Evidence-based information and reading</strong><br>
          Learning more about alcohol and recovery can make your next steps feel clearer.
          Organisations like the

            World Health Organization (WHO)
          </a>

          literature like AA’s “Big Book” or other sobriety memoirs helpful to feel less alone.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Local addiction services and counselling</strong><br>
          In many countries there are regional addiction services, counselling centres, or charities
          specialising in alcohol and drug use. For example, organisations like
          <a href="https://www.alcoholchange.org.uk/help-and-support/get-help-now"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener"

      <p>
        Reaching out for help is not a sign of weakness – it is a sign that you are taking your
        health and your future seriously. SoberPath can walk with you day by day, but deep and
        lasting recovery often becomes stronger when you combine digital tools with professional care
        and supportive communities in the real world.
